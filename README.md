# apache2

## Purpose of this Cookbook

This is a base Apache 2 cookbook for use on Ubuntu 20.04 in order to demonstrate the Inspec Test and how to move it from the traditional `\test\integration\default` path to the `\compliance\profile\apache2` path in order to use this for both integration testing as well as the Compliance Phase.

## More to Come

As I build out the Demo, there will be more to come here.
